# Hello Laravel – Getting Started

This is the first step in my Laravel learning journey using Jeffrey Way’s course.

## What I Learned

- **Laravel History & Community**: Laravel has grown from a small community to a global framework with events like Laracon.
- **Development Environment**: Set up a modern PHP development stack using [Laravel Herd](https://laravel.com/herd), a one-click solution for macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **Laravel Herd Features**:
  - Automatic project serving (e.g., `http://example.test`)
  - Easy PHP version switching
  - Built-in Composer and Laravel binary
- **Creating a Laravel Project**:
  - Used `laravel new example` inside the `~/Herd` directory
  - Chose SQLite for the database for simplicity
  - Started with a blank Laravel app (no starter kits)
